Language models are trained using unlabelled data, which means that the data does not have any labels or categories associated with it. This is because the goal of a language model is to predict the next word in a sequence of words, and the data does not need to be labeled in order to achieve this goal.\n\nHowever, some companies may use different approaches to make language models safer. For example, they may use techniques such as data augmentation or regularization to improve the robustness of the model.

In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.\n\nSupervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of", "No, because the agent does not know the correct action to take. It must learn the correct action by trial and error. This is the difference between supervised and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the agent is given the correct answer. In reinforcement learning, the agent must learn the correct answer by trial and error.\n\nWhat is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Can you give an example of each?
